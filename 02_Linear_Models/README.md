# Linear model examples

This folder contains some basic linear model examples using helical tools in various forms.

* Run `bash ./Least_Squares_A.sh` to run the first example end to end. This example is a bash script designed to be examined step by step with every piece of the computation broken out line by line.
* Run `bash ./Least_Squares_B.sh` runs the same example but demonstrates how the various computations can be batched into a single expression file for use in `helical euler expr`.
* Both examples also demonstrate the use of both direct solves (via matrix inversion) and iterative solves via PCG.
